<br>
<h1> Legio Cybernetica Cohort </h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Strategy Rating of 2</b>. All formations have an <b>Initiative rating of 2+</b>. Formations composed entirely by Paragon of Metal automata have a <b> Initiative rating of 1+</b>. <br>
<br>
<b> Legions of Steel. </b> More than half of your army's formations must contain robots. Your Cortex controllers have 3 times the range of taghmata ones. <br>
(optional)Formations containing only units with the Robot or Paragon of Metal special rule (or bombots) may contest but not score objectives unless they contain tech-priests(Arch-Magos, Domini, Aux.s, Myrm.s or Tech.s) or Tech-Thralls. <br>
(optional)If during a tie-break there are no units with the Cortex Controller/Improved Cortex Controller special rule in your army you lose an additional 100 victory points. <br>

<br>
<h2><span> Special Rules </span></h2>

<b> Robot.</b> <i>Machine-creatures beyond anything servitors or cogitator controlled constructs are capable of, but without the dangers of revolt. Or so it's claimed.</i> Robots count as having the Cybernetica Cortex and Automaton special rules. <br> 
<br>
<b> Automaton.</b> A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automaton is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Automaton units hit by a weapon with disrupt do take a Blast marker however. If a hit is inflicted on an automaton unit because it is in a broken formation which is receiving a Blast marker (see Blast Markers and Broken Formations) then it may attempt to save normally.<br>
<br>
<b> Cybernetica Cortex.</b> Formations containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule suffer a -1 initiative penalty and may not perform March or Overwatch actions if there are no friendly units with the Cortex Controller(x) special rule within x cm (example. 45cm) of the formation when activating. <br>  
<br>
<b> Cortex Controller.</b> All the units that have this special rule in the list have a 45 cm range so the brackets + number have been omitted. <br>  
<br>
<b> Paragon of Metal.</b> <i>Even among these technological marvels from the dark age of technology there are some machines that far surpass their peers. These near-unstoppable war engines could be blessed by the Omnissiah, products of exceptional genius, or influenced by forbidden knowledge.</i> PoM count as having the <b> Inspiring</b>,<b> Fearless</b>, <b> Leader</b> special rules and add +2 to their CC stat (to a max of 2+), if this army includes a supreme commander the first PoM must be part of his formation. <br> 
<br>
<b> Lance. </b> An Armoured Vehicle (AV) unit with the <b>Reinforced Armour</b> special rule that is hit by a <b>Lance</b> weapon is not allowed to re-roll its saving throw. This special rule does not affect Infantry (INF) or Light Vehicles (LV) units.<br>
<br>
<b> Sluggish. </b> Formations containing units with this special rule may not take a march action.<br>
<br>

<h2><span> Line Detachments</span></h2>
Line detachments other than tech-thralls have access to all the upgrades and may choose up to four, each upgrade for that detachment can only be chosen once and only one transport option may be selected. 
<br>The Technicians upgrade is an exception and may be chosen twice.

<table>
<tbody>

<tr><td>
<b> Summoned Units.</b> Formations that purchase the Daemonic Pact upgrade or units with that special rule, allow the Chaos player to summon daemons to the battlefield. To summon Daemons the player must also have a Daemonic pool from which to summon. This pool contains two sections, one for lesser daemons and one for greater daemons and is not faction specific. The size of such pools must be visible to all players at all times and it is suggested that either tokens or dice are used to indicate the size of each pool available. As daemons are summoned the pool must be changed to reflect its current size.<br>
<br> To summon daemons the Chaos player chooses a formation with a daemonic pact and declares its intention to summon before any action roll is made. The player then rolls 2D3 to generate the number of summoning points available for this formation. The number of points required to summon each type of daemonic unit will be noted on its data sheet. The formation may then summon daemons up to the number of summoning points generated, up to the number of points left in the daemonic pool. Any points not used are lost.<br>
<br> The faction of the summoning formation determines what type of daemons may be summoned; Sarum: Khorne, Zhao-Arkhad: Tzeentch.<br>

<br> Players may only have one greater daemon for a given faction on the table at a time. Summoned units must be set up within 5cm of a non-summoned unit in the summoning formation. They cannot be placed in enemy zones of control or impassable terrain. <br>
<br> Summoned units become part of the summoning formation for all rules purposes as long as they remain on the battlefield. Summoned units do not cause blast markers when they are destroyed, however daemonic units killed in an assault count towards the number of units killed when calculating the modifiers for assault resolution. Summoned units that are destroyed are removed from play and the summoning cost of each unit is lost from the playerâ€™s daemonic pool. <br>
<br> Summoned units remain in play until the end phase of the turn in which they were summoned. After all formations have attempted to rally any summoned units are removed from play and returned to the daemonic pool. This may cause the formation to break as it may now have equal or more blast markers than its number of units. Greater Daemons returned to the Greater daemon pool keep any damage points taken and do not heal these points while off board. When summoned subsequently they maintain this damage. <br>
<br> When a formation breaks all of its summoned units are destroyed. When calculating victory points, the Lesser Daemon pool scores half points if the pool has less than or equal to half (round up) its original number of daemons remaining. The Lesser Daemon pool scores full points if the pool has less than or equal to a quarter (round up) its daemons remaining. Treat Greater Daemons as war engines for the purpose of calculating victory points. <br>

<b> Favour of the Gods.</b> In the strategy phase of each turn if the Cybernetica player rolls a 6 they are rewarded with 1D3 summoning points to add to any lesser daemon pool, however, if they roll a 1 then they lose 1D3 summoning points from any lesser daemon pool.<br>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b> Augment Summoning.</b> Units with the augment summoning ability add to the dice roll when their formation summons daemons. For example a unit with Augment Summoning (2D3) would give its formation 4D3 summoning points when it summons daemons and a unit with Augment Summoning (6) would give its formation 2D3 + 6 summoning points.<br>

<tr><td>
<b> Daemonic Focus.</b>  Any formation with a unit with the daemonic focus ability may elect to keep any or all summoned units in play in the end phase. Broken formations may not use this ability as any daemons summoned by this formation are lost when the formation breaks.<br>

<br>
<b> Malifica.</b>  The formation acts as a third player, it will always make a move, then shoot and start an assault in this order on the closest formation(friendly, enemy or even other Malifica) if able to. If an unit reaches an enemy zone of control outside of assaults, it stops it's move before getting inside. Consolidation moves are also toward the closest formation. From then on, it is the first activation of subsequent turns (in case of multiple malifica select which ones go first randomly, using dice), before the strategy roll or teleport, following the model above. 
<br>
Regardless of its actions, this formation is not considered part of any player's force for the purposes of placing formations, holding objectives, or determining victory conditions and tie-breaker calculations but is considered for both when calculating crossfire. The rampaging robots will contest objectives for both players.
<br>
	
<b> Fleshbane. </b> A hit generated from a <b>Fleshbane</b>  weapon attack reduces the target's saving throw by one (-1). This modifier only applies to a hit generated by the Anti Personnel (AP), Close Combat (CC) or Firefight (FF) to hit value that is allocated against Infantry (INF) or (LV) units. This effect is ignored when hitting or allocated against Armored Vehicles (AV) or War Engines (WE).  <br>
<br>
<b> Armorbane. </b> A hit generated from a <b>Armorbane</b> weapon attack reduces the target's saving throw by one (-1). This modifier only applies to a hit generated by the Anti-Tank (AT), Close Combat (CC) or Firefight (FF) to hit value that is allocated against Light Vehicles (LV) units, Armored Vehicles (AV) or War Engines (WE). This effect is ignored when hitting or allocated against Infantry (INF).  <br>
<br>
<b> Harpoons.</b> During an assault, between step III and step IV, units with this rule can choose to roll a d6(3+) for each unit with this special rule, for each success the unit closest to an enemy one within 16cm that isn't in BtB contact or has been hit by other harpoons can drag the enemy one 8cm towards itself. This forces popped up skimmers to pop down, and get into CC if they get in BtB contact. This special rule only has effect if the unit that has it is the same size or bigger than the one being harpooned (WE>AV>LV>INF)(ex. WEs with 3dc can't harpoon WEs with 8dc, LVs can harpoon INF and other LVs). Harpoons can drag units through other units but not into impassable terrain, before this happens the units stop. Immobile units can't be harpooned and aren't counted for determining which units do.<br>
