<h1> Khornate Legio Cybernetica </h1>

<b>Strategy Rating of 2</b>. All formations have an <b>Initiative rating of 2+</b> except those containing <b>Malifica units which have an Initiative rating of 3+</b>. <br>
<br>
<h2><span> Special Rules </span></h2>





<b> Summoned Units.</b> Formations that purchase the Daemonic Pact upgrade, or units with this ability, allow the Chaos player to summon daemons to the battlefield. To summon Daemons the player must also have a Daemonic pool from which to summon. This pool contains two sections, one for lesser daemons and one for greater daemons and is not faction specific. The size of such pools must be visible to all players at all times and it is suggested that either tokens or dice are used to indicate the size of each pool available. As daemons are summoned the pool must be changed to reflect its current size.<br>
<br> To summon daemons the Chaos player chooses a formation with a daemonic pact and declares its intention to summon before any action roll is made. The player then rolls 2D3 to generate the number of summoning points available for this formation. The number of points required to summon each type of daemonic unit will be noted on its data sheet. The formation may then summon daemons up to the number of summoning points generated, up to the number of points left in the daemonic pool. Any points not used are lost.<br>
<br> The faction of the summoning formation determines what type of daemons may be summoned; all formations in a Khornate Cybernetica army belong to the Khorne faction.<br>
<br><br> Khorne: Bloodthirster, Bloodletters, Flesh Hounds <br><br>
<br> Players may only have one greater daemon for a given faction on the table at a time. Summoned units must be set up within 5cm of a non-summoned unit in the summoning formation. They cannot be placed in enemy zones of control or impassable terrain. <br>
<br> Summoned units become part of the summoning formation for all rules purposes as long as they remain on the battlefield. Summoned units do not cause blast markers when they are destroyed, however daemonic units killed in an assault count towards the number of units killed when calculating the modifiers for assault resolution. Summoned units that are destroyed are removed from play and the summoning cost of each unit is lost from the playerâ€™s daemonic pool. <br>

<br> Summoned units remain in play until the end phase of the turn in which they were summoned. After all formations have attempted to rally any summoned units are removed from play and returned to the daemonic pool. This may cause the formation to break as it may now have equal or more blast markers than its number of units. Greater Daemons returned to the Greater daemon pool keep any damage points taken and do not heal these points while off board. When summoned subsequently they maintain this damage. <br>


<br> When a formation breaks all of its summoned units are destroyed. When calculating victory points, the Lesser Daemon pool scores half points if the pool has less than or equal to half (round up) its original number of daemons remaining. The Lesser Daemon pool scores full points if the pool has less than or equal to a quarter (round up) its daemons remaining. Treat Greater Daemons as war engines for the purpose of calculating victory points. <br>


<br><br><br>  

<br>
<b> Favour of the Gods.</b> In the strategy phase of each turn if the Cybernetica player rolls a 6 they are rewarded with 1D3 summoning points to add to any lesser daemon pool, however, if they roll a 1 then they lose 1D3 summoning points from any lesser daemon pool.<br>
<br>
<b> Augment Summoning.</b> Units with the augment summoning ability add to the dice roll when their formation summons daemons. For example a unit with Augment Summoning (2D3) would give its formation 4D3 summoning points when it summons daemons and a unit with Augment Summoning (6) would give its formation 2D3 + 6 summoning points.<br>
<br>
<b> Daemonic Focus.</b>  Any formation with a unit with the daemonic focus ability may elect to keep any or all summoned units in play in the end phase. Broken formations may not use this ability as any daemons summoned by this formation are lost when the formation breaks.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br>  

<b> Improved Cortex Controller.</b> Allows any formation containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule to operate normally, for the purpose of selecting an action and activating, as long as that formations has a unit within 45cm of a unit with this special rule.<br>  
<br>
<b> Cybernetica Cortex.</b> Formations containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule suffer a -1 initiative penalty and may not perform March or Overwatch actions, if there are no friendly units with the Cortex Controller special rule within 15 cm of the formation or Improved Cortex Controller within 45cm of the formation. <br>  
<br>
<b> Automaton.</b> A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automaton is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Automaton units hit by a weapon with disrupt do take a Blast marker however. If a hit is inflicted on an automaton unit because it is in a broken formation which is receiving a Blast marker (see Blast Markers and Broken Formations) then it may attempt to save normally.<br>
<br>
<b> Lance. </b> An Armoured Vehicle (AV) unit with the <b>Reinforced Armour</b> special rule that is hit by a <b>Lance</b> weapon is not allowed to re-roll its saving throw. This special rule does not affect Infantry (INF) or Light Vehicles (LV) units.<br>
<br>
<b> Daemonic Rage.</b> Formations containing units with this rule receive a +1 modifier to their action test roll when attempting an engage action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
More than half of your army's formations must have a majority of robots.
Formations containing only units with the Cybernetica Cortex special rule may not score objectives, if at the end of the game there are no units with the Cortex Controller or Improved Cortex Controller special rule you lose 1 vp.

<b> Cybertheurgist</b> : Units with this special rule may forego shooting for a round to use a power from this list and apply it on a friendly formation within cortex controller range, on a roll of 1 (or 1-2 in the case of the rite of immolation) the power goes awry, roll on the mishap table.<br>

successful, the affected formation must skip it's next activation, with the robots inside counting as ff- cc-  if engaged in an assault.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td> Rite of Dread Castigation
</td>
<td> 5+
</td>
<td> Unlike the other listed powers, this ability may only be used against an enemy formation containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule within 
range and represents a form of attack rather than augmentation. If the power is successfully used, both the Cybertheurgistâ€™s player and the controlling 
player of the formation targeted each roll a D6(+ strategy rating), the target formation suffers one MW hit for each point that the attackerâ€™s total score exceeds 
that of the defenderâ€™s total score.
If an attempt at the Rite of Dread Castigation incurs a roll on the Cybertheurgy Mishap table, the Corrosive Paradox result occurs automatically, 
except that it is the Cybertheurgist, not the target model, that suffers the effect.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td> Rite of Immolation
</td>
<td> 5+
</td>
<td> By overcoming the safety protocols and self-preservation systems of the robot's reactor core, the Cybertheurgist forces the machine creature to 
catastrophically self-destruct. If the power is used successfully remove a robot from the formation, all models closer than 10cm suffer a MW3+ hit.
Should a failed attempt at Rite of Immolation result in a Cybertheurgy Mishap, the Malifica result occurs automatically and there is no need to roll on the table.

The formation is now destroyed for the purpose of Victory points if relevant and is no longer part of the controlling 
playerâ€™s force. If non robot units are part of the formation, the robots are split from that formation and placed out 
of coherency from it. At the end of each turn the formation will from now make a move towards and shoot at the closest 
formation each turn and then assault that same formation if able to. Both sides may now target it if they desire.
