<h3><span>What this army want to represent on the table</span></h3>
<br>
The Legio Cybernetica from the visions of heresy and other background books, specifically the traitor side and also a list that would most likely be used as allies to another list(which is why it has 1/2 as the point limit for allies and l.o.w.).
An army that is focused on heavily customizable AV walkers controlled by tech-priests, with some skitarii support (might tone them down a lot but not replace them with thralls as while the legio had both I'd prefer to keep this army list very different from the standard taghmata).
Heavily customized robots, the aetheric consecrations are there to represent more obscure and unknown automata patterns.
<br>
<h3><span>What this army doesn't want to represent</span></h3>
<br>
The Legio Cybernetica from the forgeworld heresy books but 6mm.
<br>
6mm Tank lists, while they are pretty fun the legio cybernetica should feel very different.
<br>
<h3><span>Thing to do</span></h3>
<li>add aetheric consecrations army-wide restrictions(maybe max 1-2 gods per army, for each 3(rounding down) main one you can get 1 secondary one, except renegade gods that can't be mixed in an army, stuff like "secondary one can't be tzeentch if main one is nurgle")</li>
<li>add army wide automata restriction (2 security automata types are too many even if their stats are the complete opposite)</li>
<li>finish cybertheurgy and make it waaaay more simple</li>
<li>make the entire army waayy less complex</li>
<li>typeset the codex and tidy up the upgrades as everything gets repeated so much</li>
<li>REBALANCE EVERYTHING LIKE HOLY SHIT WOW THIS GOES FAR BEYOND AN ELITE ARMY, LOWER PRICES AND STATS </li>
<li>Add transports? What would even transport them? War engines? A termite for each robot? Is the war engine a flyer? It would make sense considering that some way or the other they are getting from ground to space and vice-versa. But on the battlefield would a tracked and armoured crawler type make more sense?</li>
<li>Drop pods for robots? That solves half of the question I guess and makes sense but getting them into space still requires something big.</li>
<li>More flyers</li>
<li>The legio cybernetica made heavy use of spacecraft, as the mechanicum made illegal for the legio to own planetry forges, so at least a cruiser would make sense for orbital support</li>
<li>The legio rarely went to battle alone so maybe force a minimum of 1/3 or 1/4 spent on allies? If the player only wants to use robot models he can proxy the units maybe?</li>

<h3><span>Units to rebalance again</span></h3>
<li>Thanatars</li>
<li>Cybernetica myrmidons</li>
<li>Datasmiths</li>
<li>Archmagi</li>
<li>Hereteks</li>
<li>Lords of war</li>
<li>Bombots</li>
<li>Upgrades for formations, keep the things that need to be kept track of to a minimum(add army-wide restrictions to the things)</li>
<li>Domitars? Lore and 28mm makes them out to be extremely powerful at melee range, scrapping enemy armour and monsters with ease and disrupting charges with the grav hammers which makes them pretty good at defending things, maybe they should be an upgrade to add some at punch to other formations</li>

<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
Legio Cybernetica armies have a <b>Strategy Rating of 3</b>. All formations have an <b>Initiative rating of 2+</b>. <br>
<br>
<h2><span>Special Rules</span></h2>

<b>Automaton.</b> A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automaton is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Automaton units hit by a weapon with disrupt do take a Blast marker however. If a hit is inflicted on an automaton unit because it is in a broken formation which is receiving a Blast marker (see Blast Markers and Broken Formations) then it may attempt to save normally.<br>
<br>
<b>Improved Cortex Controller.</b> Allows any formation containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule to operate normally, for the purpose of selecting an action and activating, as long as that formations has a unit within 25cm of a unit with this special rule.<br>
<br>
<b>Improved Cybernetica Cortex.</b> Formations containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule suffer a -1 initiative penalty and may not perform March or Overwatch actions, if there are no friendly units with the Cortex Controller special rule within 15 cm of the formation, unless the formation chooses to repeat the last order received when under effect of a cortex controller, if it does it ignores the initiative penality, if it chooses to change orders then the previous rules apply.<br>
<br>
<i>Lance.</i> A weapon with the <i>Lance</i> special rule is designed to destroy heavily armoured targets. An Armoured Vehicle (AV) unit with the <i>Reinforced Armour</i> special rule that is hit by a <i>Lance</i> weapon is not allowed to re-roll its saving throw. This special rule does not affect Infantry (INF) or Light Vehicles (LV) units.<br>
<br>
<i>Singularity.</i> At its height, the Horus Heresy, saw both sides turn to outlawed dark age technologies. <i>Singularity</i> weapons are capable of generating a continuous discharge of energy. When rolling to hit, with a <i>Singularity</i> weapon, any unmodified to hit roll of six (6), generates an additional attack die. Successive rolls of a natural six can generate additional dice.<br>
<br>
<i>Void Shields.</i> Some units are protected by void shield generators. Each void shield will stop one point of damage and then go down. Do not make armour saves for damage stopped by void shields, nor allocate blast markers. Once all of the shields have been knocked down, the unit may be damaged normally and you may make saving throws against any hits that are allocated. Hits from close combat ignore void shields but units using their firefight value must first knock down any shields before they can damage the unit. Void shields that have been knocked down can be repaired. A unit can repair one downed void shield in the end phase of each turn. In addition, if a unit regroups it can use the dice roll to either repair a void shield or remove blast markers (e.g., if you rolled a 2 you could repair 2 shields, remove 2 blast markers or repair 1 shield and remove 1 blast marker).<br>
<br>
<i>Allies.</i> Armies may ally with a wide range of factions in the Heresy supplement, while some are easily incorporated into your force others have a disruptive effect on your overall strategy. Any formations from a “Disruptive” ally reduce the army’s strategy rating by one (-1). Additionally, Supreme Commander rerolls may not be used on “Disruptive” ally formations. Allied force selections must comply with any restrictions within their own army lists. When including formations from an ally army list, the restrictions for Space Craft and Supreme Commanders are applied across the entire force. Only one Supreme Commander can be selected and they must come from the primary army list. For example, an allies line detachment must be purchased before you can purchase an allies support detachment.<br>
 
<h2><span>Line Detachments</span></h2>
<br>
A line detachment may choose up to four upgrades, each upgrade for that detachment can only be chosen once and only one transport option may be selected.
