<h3><span> What this army want to represent on the table </span></h3>
<br>
Cool robots.
An army that is focused on heavily customizable AV walkers controlled by tech-priests that slowly creeps towards the enemy while firing, with some skitarii support.
The aetheric consecrations are there to represent more obscure and unknown automata patterns and equipment.
<br>
<br>
<h3><span>Thing to do</span></h3>
<li> finish cybertheurgy and make it waaaay more simple</li>
<li> make the entire army waayy less complex</li>
<li> typeset the codex </li>
<li> REBALANCE EVERYTHING</li>
<li> Simplify most of the army specific rules</li>
<br>
Patterns / Aetheric Consecrations / Gods: 
<li> add aetheric consecrations army-wide restrictions(1-2 gods per army, renegade gods with others can't be mixed in an army(single god armies), stuff like "secondary one can't be tzeentch if main one is nurgle")</li>
<li> army wide automata restriction? (max number of patterns? marines have a ton of unit with different stats but the models are readable compared to the aetheric consecrations mods)</li>
<br>
Transports: 
<li> Add transports? What would even transport them? War engines? A termite for each robot? Is the war engine a flyer? It would make sense considering that some way or the other they are getting from ground to space and vice-versa. But on the battlefield would a tracked and armoured crawler type make more sense?</li>
<li> Drop pods for robots? That solves half of the question I guess and makes sense but getting them into space still requires something big.</li>
<br>
<li> More flyers</li>
<br>
Navy: 
<li> The legio cybernetica made heavy use of spacecraft, as the mechanicum made illegal for the legio to own planetry forges, so making the limit 0-2 could be a thing for orbital support</li>
<li> The legio rarely went to battle alone so maybe force a minimum of 1/4 spent on allies? If the player only wants to use robot models he can proxy the units maybe?</li>

<h2><span> Introduction </span></h2>
Legio Cybernetica armies have a <b>Strategy Rating of 3</b>. All formations have an <b>Initiative rating of 2+</b>. <br>
<br>
<h2><span> Special Rules </span></h2>
<a href="https://spaal574.github.io/latex/codex/30k_DarkCybernetica_Extra_Rules.html"> Full list of the rules </a> <br>
<b> Automaton.</b> A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with automaton is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move. Automaton units hit by a weapon with disrupt do take a Blast marker however. If a hit is inflicted on an automaton unit because it is in a broken formation which is receiving a Blast marker (see Blast Markers and Broken Formations) then it may attempt to save normally.<br>
<br>
<i> Lance. </i> A weapon with the <i>Lance</i> special rule is designed to destroy heavily armoured targets. An Armoured Vehicle (AV) unit with the <i>Reinforced Armour</i> special rule that is hit by a <i>Lance</i> weapon is not allowed to re-roll its saving throw. This special rule does not affect Infantry (INF) or Light Vehicles (LV) units.<br>
<br>
<i> Singularity. </i> At its height, the Horus Heresy, saw both sides turn to outlawed dark age technologies. <i>Singularity</i> weapons are capable of generating a continuous discharge of energy. When rolling to hit, with a <i>Singularity</i> weapon, any unmodified to hit roll of six (6), generates an additional attack die. Successive rolls of a natural six can generate additional dice.<br>
<br>
<i> Void Shields. </i> Some units are protected by void shield generators. Each void shield will stop one point of damage and then go down. Do not make armour saves for damage stopped by void shields, nor allocate blast markers. Once all of the shields have been knocked down, the unit may be damaged normally and you may make saving throws against any hits that are allocated. Hits from close combat ignore void shields but units using their firefight value must first knock down any shields before they can damage the unit. Void shields that have been knocked down can be repaired. A unit can repair one downed void shield in the end phase of each turn. In addition, if a unit regroups it can use the dice roll to either repair a void shield or remove blast markers (e.g., if you rolled a 2 you could repair 2 shields, remove 2 blast markers or repair 1 shield and remove 1 blast marker).<br>
<br>
<i> Allies. </i> Armies may ally with a wide range of factions in the Heresy supplement, while some are easily incorporated into your force others have a disruptive effect on your overall strategy. Any formations from a “Disruptive” ally reduce the army’s strategy rating by one (-1). Additionally, Supreme Commander rerolls may not be used on “Disruptive” ally formations. Allied force selections must comply with any restrictions within their own army lists. When including formations from an ally army list, the restrictions for Space Craft and Supreme Commanders are applied across the entire force. Only one Supreme Commander can be selected and they must come from the primary army list. For example, an allies line detachment must be purchased before you can purchase an allies support detachment.<br>
 
<h2><span> Line Detachments</span></h2>
A line detachment may choose up to four upgrades, each upgrade for that detachment can only be chosen once and only one transport option may be selected.
