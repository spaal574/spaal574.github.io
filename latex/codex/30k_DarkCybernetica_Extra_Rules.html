<h4>Extra Rules(do not use these)</h4>  
<br>
<br>  
<dl>
  <dt><b> Improved Cybernetica Cortex.</b> If there are no friendly units with the Cortex Controller special rule within cortex control range of the formation, formations containing units with the Cybernetica Cortex rule suffer a -1 initiative penalty and may not perform March or Overwatch actions.</dt>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> Optional part of the rule (discuss before playing if you want to use this part, I'd suggest against using it and just wrote it in for completeness sake)</dd>
  <dd> If the player decides to change order, then the above rules apply till the next time the formation gets into controller range.</dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> The controlling player can choose to use the rules below and ignore the penality above until the formation changes orders or re-enters controller range.</dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> If they do, place a token(for every formation that WAS under control and that is using these rules and choose one for this formation) on the spot where the last unit that was cortex controlling the formation was before being removed.</dd>
  <dd> Note the action last taken, the movement and the direction and distance of the last firefight,heavy weapons attack or barrage on a piece of paper (all of this relative to the token, if the token wasn't part of this formation then this is relative to one of the battle automata of the player's choice that was/is).</dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd> 
  <dd> The formation executes the order. </dd>
  <dd> (Example: The formation makes an "advance"(move and then shoot)). </dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> Move the token in the same speed and direction of the last order EVEN if it means moving it into impassable terrain. </dd>
  <dd> (Example: The token moves 5cm to the right and 6cm to the top, this puts him off a cliff.) </dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> The battle automata move into formation coherency, if no battle automata can reach coherency remove the formation and the token from play.</dd>
  <dd> (Example: 4 castellax move into coherency and 2 end up into impassable terrain (down the cliff), they are destroyed.)</dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> Put a ruler on the token and move it in the direction of the last assault/firefight/heavy weapons attack/barrage, if the point is out of range then the formation doesn't fire.</dd>
  <dd> (Example: The formation shoot at a titan last turn that was around 17 cm to the left and 4 cm to the bottom with a thanatar armed with a sollex lascannon, that thanatar was destroyed and now the formation only has bolt cannons.)</dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> The formation repeates the last attack on the closest formation to that point. </dd>
  <dd> (Example: The formation attacks a friendly skitarii formation which is the closest formation near the point using the AT property of their weapons.) </dd>
  <dd> Continue the rest of stuff as normal. </dd>
  <dd> <br> </dd>
  <dd> When the formation is destroyed/changes orders, remove the token.</dd>
  <dd> The token has no stats, doesn't count as an unit and doesn't/isn't affected by anything else(cybertheurgy powers don't affect it unless noted). </dd>
  <dd> The formation must always remain in coherency with the token and if any units fall outside of coherence with the formation then the player must always choose the part of the formation with token as the one in coherence.</dd>
  <dd> If the controlling player doesn't remember the specifics of the last move then just use the penality part of the rule.</dd>
